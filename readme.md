#Installing
On Linux/Mac OS:

```
virtualenv-3.5 env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#Running
In the future we should launch from the file called `run.py`.

#Testing
Create tests using PyTest. Documentation online.

#Structure
View src for appropriate structure. Each folder should have tests affiliated with it. Eventually there will be a `test.py` for all tests.
